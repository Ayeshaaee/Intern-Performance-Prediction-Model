# Intern-Performance-Prediction-Model

 AI-Powered Intern Performance Predictor
Machine Learning | HR Tech | Data Science
I developed a smart ML-based system to predict intern performance using task completion data and feedback metrics. The project leverages XGBoost and Random Forest regression models to classify interns into High, Medium, and Low performers.

 Key Highlights:
Preprocessed real-world data, handled missing values, and scaled features for modeling.
Trained and evaluated both models using RÂ² score and RMSE.
Visualized results through intuitive Seaborn plots showing performance distribution.
Assigned productivity categories based on prediction scores for actionable insight.

Outcome:
This tool helps internship teams identify top talent early, spot performance gaps, and make data-backed decisions for retention or training.
